        THE DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION OF CROSS-SECTOR COMMUNICATION
        FRAMEWORK FOR GHANA’S SECURITY AGENCIES

      This project, developed in partial fulfillment of
      the requirements for the award of the Master of
      Science in Information Technology, presents a cross-sector
      Security Information Management System designed to enhance secure
      communication and collaboration among national security institutions.

      The system provides a unified digital platform that enables authorized
      agencies to share, manage, and verify critical information in real time,
      thereby overcoming the persistent challenges of fragmented communication channels,
      delayed information flow, and reliance on unsecured third-party applications.
     
      By integrating features such as user authentication, role-based access
      control, and centralized data management, the system strengthens inter-agency
      coordination and reduces the risk of misinformation and cyber threats.
     
      Its implementation ensures improved operational efficiency,
      faster decision-making during emergencies, and protection of sensitive
      national data from external interference. Ultimately, this system
      serves as a strategic technological framework aimed at promoting
      interoperability, transparency, and data sovereignty within the
      national security communication infrastructure.
